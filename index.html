                    <p>Hi, I'm Alex Bradshaw, a passionate networking and cybersecurity student with a strong foundation in web development and IT infrastructure. I thrive on solving complex security challenges, optimizing network performance, and designing user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
                    <p>I am currently in my third year at the University of Cincinnati. Through my coursework, I have developed hands-on expertise in network administration and cybersecurity protocols.</p>
                    <p>I worked with the Ohio Code Scholar initiative, where I traveled to K-12 schools to teach students about coding, 3D printing, and robotics. This experience has strengthened my ability to explain complex technical concepts in an accessible way. Additionally, I've built static websites, managed domain controllers, and assisted in setting up cybersecurity labs.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not working on IT projects, I enjoy diving into sci-fi and fantasy worlds, whether through video games, anime, or tabletop RPGs. I also love discussing Star Wars lore, military history, and exploring the intersection of AI and storytelling.</p>
                    <p>I'm always open to new opportunities, whether it's collaborating on projects, discussing cybersecurity trends, or working on innovative tech solutions. Feel free to check out my work or reach out!</p>

                    <p>My html class has been very fun and fulfilling and full of hands on projects that resulted in something more than a paper as a result and are much more fun showing off. Throughout this class I have learned about HTML and CSS primarily, but also delved a little bit into JavaScript for a project.</p>

                    <h3>My Cybersecurity Employee Training Videos</h3>
                    <p>This project was the result of a research paper that I wrote about the cybersecurity knowledge gap between technical and non-technical end users. My research pointed to the reason for this gap was education, which makes sense as you don't know what you don't know. As a result my project was to make user training videos that were non-technical but would still strengthin and promote a culture of cybersecurity as the end user is the first line of defense for an organization.</p>

                    <p>This praject started when my proffesor suggested that I do this really cool project and it shouldn't be that hard becuase the code is already made. Well 250+ hours later I finally finished it. I learned alot throughout this project. It was frustraing, challenging, and rewarding. The brain of this project was a Raspberry Pi. It was a custom command-line linux based OS.</p>

                    <p>This Half-Scale R2-D2 Dome was created by my proffesor Dr. Josh Montgomery for the Ohio Code Scholar program. This dome is a project based educational tool to teach elementary through high school students Engineering principles. It promotes the idea of failing forward. The lessons learned through failing, in one word perseverance. The skills include 3D design, 3D printing, circuitry, wiring, coding, project management, and soldering. As well as soft skills including, communication, teamwork, and leadership.</p>

                    <h3>My Battlebot</h3>
                    <p>This project was the second year of the Ohio Code Scholar program. It was proposed by a member of the program. It is a popular form of projects for high school and college students. This project put a huge emphisis on individual creativity. The entire base and the weapon system had to be 3D designed and printed. I was again the trial test builder. The base model for the bot has an Arduino Nano and 4 motors for wheels. I built it with the base pieces, a larger motor, a sensor, a motor hat, and a 3D designed and printed circular saw.</p>

                    <h3>My Games Made For Recruitment Events
                    </h3>
                    <p>These games were created for recruitment events for the Computer Science program at Southern State Community College. They were inspired by the want to show potential students some of the cool things that we do and learn by being apart of the program. They were written in either Java or Python. I am not a coding student but I found the project to be very challanging but fulfilling. One game is guessing a password by using hints to uncover the password focusing on cybersecurity concepts. The second is a simple logic statment that needs to be completed focusing on coding basics. The third is demonstrating a simplified version of Dijkstra algorithm focusing on networking concepts.</p>
